### prototype

Protypes are the mechanism by which Javascript objects inherit features from one another.
Every object has a built in property called prototype. The property is itself an object. The property chain end when we reach a property that has null for its own property.

Object.prototype
Date.prototype
Array.prototype





###  callback
A function that is passed into another function (known as higher function) as an argument.
The callback function can then be invoked inside the higher order function.
In JS all functions are objects.

###   async/ await

###  promises
